## Inspiration

As high school students going into college and adult life in the next few years, it becomes apparently obvious to us that both ourselves and our peers suffer from a lack of common knowledge of practical life skills. Skills, like cooking for yourself, maintaining your own car, budgeting your money, and even doing your own laundry, are sometimes not evident to a lot of kids. Lyfe aims to provide a structured educational resource to provide knowledge and information to potential users about valuable life skills.

## What it does

Lyfe provides a web-based application for users to interact with and complete lessons on varying topics and genres. Similar to a mobile application like Duolingo, Lyfe seeks to provide structured and consistent education. The only current genres we have programmed to interact with our database are Cooking, Automotive maintenance, and financing but the application has the framework and technology stack to be expanded in the future to encompass broad lessons more detailed/well-researched tutorials.

## How I built it

Lyfe utilizes Vue.js as a front-end framework with Material Design standards. User Experience and a clean UI were an evident priority in the design of the application to make it both mobile responsive and approachable for anyone.

## Challenges I ran into

Collecting the necessary data and articles to use in the lessons of our topics and genres required a lot of manual research that couldn't be easily automated due to the necessity of quality insurance. Establishing connections between Firebase and Vue also posed many issues with asynchronous JavaScript functions and method logic.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

The design, user flow, and overall User Experience of the application are likely the best and most well done of any of my recent projects. The overall aesthetic of the project is something that I pride it on.

## What I learned

Using Vue provided an interesting learning experience while integrating it with Firebase taught a lot about the distinctions between the Firestore and Firebase's other data storage solutions and how data is fetched.

## What's next for Lyfe

While the framework for the application's expansion already exists, we would like to add more genres, topics, and lessons as well as incorporate a general progression system and user-based accomplishments.
