        >Here are some simple steps for changing the tire once you have jacked up your vehicle:</p>

        <p class="title">
          1) REMOVE THE HUBCAP OR WHEEL COVER
          If your vehicle has a hubcap covering the lug nuts, it’s easier to remove the hubcap before lifting the vehicle with the jack. If your lug nuts are exposed, you can skip ahead to Step 2. Use the flat end of your lug wrench to remove the hubcap. This will work for most vehicles, but some hubcaps need a different tool to come off. Consult your owner’s manual for proper hubcap or wheel cover removal procedures.
        </p>

        <p class="title">
          2) UNSCREW THE LUG NUTS
          Using the lug wrench, turn the lug nuts counterclockwise until you break their resistance. You may have to use force, and that’s ok. Use your foot or all of your body weight if necessary.
        </p>

        <p class="title">
          3) REMOVE THE FLAT TIRE
          Gripping the tire by the treads, pull it gently toward you until it’s completely free from the hub behind it. Set it on its side so that it doesn’t roll away.
        </p>

        <p class="title">
          4) MOUNT THE SPARE TIRE ON THE LUG BOLTS
          Now place the spare on the hub by lining up the rim with the lug bolts. Push gently until the lug bolts show through the rim.
        </p>

        <p class="title">
          5) TIGHTEN THE LUG NUTS BY HAND
          Put the lug nuts back on the lug bolts and tighten them all the way by hand. Once they are all on, check each one again, tightening as much as possible. You will tighten them with the wrench after lowering the vehicle to the ground.
        </p>

        <p class="title">
          6) LOWER THE VEHICLE AND TIGHTEN THE LUG NUTS AGAIN
          Use the jack to lower the vehicle so that the spare tire is resting on the ground but the full weight of the vehicle isn’t fully on the tire. At this point, you should tighten the lug nuts with the wrench, turning clockwise, as much as you can. Push down on the lug wrench with the full weight of your body.
        </p>

        <p class="title">
          7) LOWER THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY
          Bring the vehicle all the way to the ground and remove the jack. Give the lug nuts another pull with the wrench to ensure they’re as tight as possible.
        </p>

        <p class="title">
          8) REPLACE THE HUBCAP
          If the hubcap you took from the flat tire will fit your spare, put it in place the same way you removed it initially. If it doesn’t fit, stow it away with the tire when you stow your equipment.
