        >There are a lot of different ways to describe cooking food with a little oil in a pan. And many people use them interchangeably. (Some recipes even just call that “cooking.”) But there are some subtle differences in each technique:</p>

        >1) Sauté: It literally means “jump” in French. Applied to cooking, this describes the motion of your food in the pan, so do lots of stirring and some tossing as the food cooks. The basic idea here is quick cooking over medium-high heat, stirring frequently.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >2) Stir-Fry: When stir-frying, everything gets kicked up a notch. Stir-frying usually happens over very high heat — as high as your stove can go. The ingredients need to move constantly in the pan so they don’t burn</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >3) Sear: Searing is like sautéing taken down a few notches. You don’t move the food around as much, because the goal is to develop deep browning and caramelization on the underside of the ingredient.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >4) Brown: Browning applies to meat and refers to cooking it just enough to turn it, well, brown. This usually happens over lower heat than searing or sautéing.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >When searing meat or even vegetables like potatoes, what you’re looking to do is to create a crispy exterior. This comes when the dry food hits the hot oil in the pan and begins to crisp. It’s actually a chemical process called the Maillard Reaction, and is what gives seared food so much flavor. Here are a few tips for doing it well:</p>

        <p class="title">1) Make sure your food is dry.</p>

        <p class="title">2) Heat the pan until the oil is hot (but not smoking).</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >3) Place the room-temperature food into the pan. Cold food will cool down the pan and the oil, and may prevent the reaction from taking place.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >4) Leave the food alone for several minutes. This can be difficult, as the urge to begin flipping the food is strong. But the Maillard Reaction needs a little time to take place.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >5) Don’t worry if it sticks to the pan at first. Especially if you’re using a cast iron or steel pan, this is expected — and is part of the process.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >6) Give the pan a gentle shake. Most foods will tell you when they are ready to turn because a gentle shake will release them from the pan.</p>
