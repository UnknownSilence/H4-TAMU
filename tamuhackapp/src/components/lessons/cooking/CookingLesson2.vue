        >Before we get to fancy flashy knife skills, there is one extremely important thing you need to learn in order to cut with confidence.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >1) Stabilize your cutting board! Your cutting board should be on the countertop, at a comfortable height, and it should be stable. This means that if you place your hand on the board you shouldn’t be able to slide it around. If your cutting board doesn’t already have non-slip feet or a rubberized bottom, there are several easy ways to do this. The easiest little trick is to place a damp cloth or paper towel under your board, to keep it from sliding around. For a reusable option, you can also get a roll of non-slip shelf liner and cut it to fit your board. Never start cutting something without making sure your board won’t move around under your knife.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >2) Use a sharp knife: Once you have a stable working surface, you need to make sure your knife is sharp. If you’ve recently bought your knife, it’s probably sharp enough. If, like most people, you’ve owned it for years, and it’s never been sharpened, it’s time to change that. A dull knife is a dangerous knife. Dull knives require more force to cut through food, and are more likely to slip, meaning that you’re more likely to cut yourself. And on top of that, they’re just not going to do as good of a job.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >Congratulations! You have a sharp knife and a stable cutting surface! Now you finally get to pick up your knife! When it comes to fast, accurate, safe knife use, your grip is everything. You want the knife to feel completely in your control while cutting. You don’t want it to slip around (especially if your hands are greasy) and you don’t want your fingers to get anywhere in the way. So let’s look at some holding styles.</p>

        >Pinch the blade with the thumb and forefinger, wrap your hands around the bolster and curl other fingers around the handle. Pick up your knife and hold it like this. Feel how easy it is to decide exactly where to set the blade down on an ingredient. This will give you the most power and control. Holding your knife right and pinching the blade like this can be absolutely revolutionary to your speed and confidence in chopping quickly!</p>
        <p
          class="title"
        >To cut food, the important thing is to make sure that your fingers are out of the way, and that the blade is moving evenly through the food. The best way to do this is by holding food with what’s called the “claw grip,” keeping the middle of the blade close to your knuckles as a guide, and rocking the blade over the food. This gives you the most precision and control. Here’s what it looks like (without food).</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >Notice that the fingers are curled in, just slightly. This way, the knuckles can act as a guide to the knife blade, and you can safely slice food without worrying about cutting your fingers. (Definitely watch Grace demo this in the video above!)</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >If you don’t typically use this method, it may feel uncomfortable at first, but it’s far safer, and worth practicing. Especially as you get better (and faster) at cutting, it will be useful to know that your fingers are out of the way of the blade without having to think about it.</p>
