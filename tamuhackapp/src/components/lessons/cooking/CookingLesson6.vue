          While we love olive oil for its versatility, it is susceptible to burning at higher temperatures (often, anything over medium heat), especially on gas stoves. (And the heat often destroys the delicate flavors.) So if olive oil is a must for your kitchen, look for neutral-flavored high-heat olive oils for cooking and save extra virgin oils for salad dressings.
          Canola oil on the other hand, is our hands-down go-to for cooking; It is affordable, neutral in flavor and has a high enough smoke point to handle everything from pan frying to steak searing. You can use canola oil for every single cooking school assignment this month, that’s how powerful it is.

        >Avoid cooking with finishing oils or flavored oils. This includes nut oils like walnut and pistachio oils. These are luxury fats, fantastic for making salad dressings and drizzling over veg, but they tend to have lower smoke points, and the heat can destroy some of the flavors.</p>

        >Whether you choose to use nonstick, stainless steel, or cast iron pans (or a variety) is largely a matter of choice.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >Nonstick pans are ideal for (obviously) keeping food from sticking. However they can be expensive, are not particularly durable, and many shouldn’t be used for high-temperature cooking like searing or stir-fries and/or aren’t oven-safe.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >Stainless steel pans often last much longer, and are far better for browning and searing (where you want food to stick — see below). They’re also more versatile (read: able to transition between stovetop and oven). But they can be tricky to learn how to use, and it’s hard to keep certain foods, like eggs, from sticking.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >Cast iron pans are incredibly durable — one of the reasons vintage pans are a thing — and when fully seasoned, have many nonstick properties. But they can be a pain to season (another reason vintage pans are a thing), are heavy, and are a little harder to care for (they don’t do well in a dishwasher). Carbon steel pans are lighter, but have a lot of the same properties.</p>
