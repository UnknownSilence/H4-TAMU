        >Let’s talk about some basic cuts! For most root vegetables like potatoes and carrots, a recipe will generally ask you to slice, chop, dice, or mince your vegetables.</p>

        >1) Slices are straightforward: Whether it’s a carrot, potato, or celery, or another veggie, you simply make even-width slices. A mandoline or food processor often works fine for this, especially if you are cooking for a lot of people and need a large amount.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >2) Chopped: When instructions call for chopped ingredients, that indicates the pieces do not need to be terribly precise. The goal is to get evenly sized, but not perfectly uniform, cuts.</p>

        <p

        >3) Diced ingredients are different. When a recipe asks you to dice potatoes for, say, home fries, the goal is to get them into evenly sized cubes. About 1/2 inch is typical for a medium dice. A large dice is closer to 3/4 inch, and a small dice is closer to 1/4 inch. But again, the most important part is that the food is roughly the same size.

        >4) Minced: Finally, there’s minced. This is something recipes often ask you to do with herbs, garlic, or other flavorful aromatics that should be spread through a dish. Mincing is a very fun way to cut, because it’s hard to do wrong: You simply chop everything up in a big pile, and then keep chopping until it becomes as small as possible. A knife works just great for this, but you can achieve a similar effect with a grater, Microplane, or even a blender.</p>
