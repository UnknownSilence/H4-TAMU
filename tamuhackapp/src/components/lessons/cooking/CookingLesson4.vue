        >Do you swagger up to the stovetop, pan in hand, with confidence? Or do you feel perplexed by oily vegetables, and meat that never quite sears the way it should? Well read on! Today we’re covering the basics of stovetop heat and oil, so you can feel like a pro whenever you’re at the stove.</p>

        <p

        >What’s the most common thing you see at the top of recipe instructions? Set a pan over medium heat. Everything from pasta sauce to soups start with heat and oil: sautéed onions, garlic, or vegetables in the bottom of a pot. But this act of banging a pan on the stove and heating it to cook in is where many novice and even experienced cooks get it wrong.</p>

        <p

        >The difference between a crispy, delicious meal and a soggy, sad mess starts before food hits the pan. Here are five smart learnings.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >1) Use the right oil. Different oils can take different amounts of heat before they start to smoke (and stop being good for cooking). We’ll cover more of that below, but in general canola and vegetable oil are most versatile. Olive oil is great for lower-heat things like sautéing (not for stir-frying or higher-heat cooking), and delicate or flavored oils should be avoided for cooking.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >2) Make sure your ingredients are dry. This is for both temperature and safety reasons. If your freshly washed ingredients are still dripping or damp, the water will immediately cool down the pan and oil. And the water will also burst into steam, causing the oil to splatter everywhere — ouch!</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >3) Get your pan hot. Some cooks recommend heating the pan before putting oil in. Others put the oil into a cold pan and heat both together. Either way, you want to get both nice and hot before food goes in. If the oil isn’t hot enough, the food will soak it up instead of sizzling in it, and it won’t taste as good. If you’re heating the pan separately, you can use a splash of water to test whether the pan is hot enough, or too hot: Watch the video above for a great visual explanation.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >4) Test the oil before putting in food. There are several easy ways to test the oil in a pan. First, when you lift the pan and swirl the oil around, it should move quickly, almost like water. Second, you should see “fingers” in the oil — meaning it should look like the oil is stretching in places when it swirls — and the oil should shimmer. Finally, when something does go into the oil, small bubbles should immediately appear. You can test this with a small piece of food — or if you have a wooden spoon, you can simply dunk the tip of the handle in. (Note: Do not try this with another material, like plastic or metal!)</p>

        >What to do if the oil begins to smoke. One benefit of putting the oil into a preheated pan is that it’s less likely to get too hot and start to smoke (especially when stir-frying). But if your oil does begin to smoke, don’t worry: Simply remove it from the heat, pour out the oil into a heat-proof (glass or ceramic) container, turn down the heat, and start again.</p>
