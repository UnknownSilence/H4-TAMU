        >There are two basic types of 401(k) accounts: traditional 401(k)s and Roth 401(k)s, sometimes referred to as a "designated Roth account." The two are similar in many respects but are taxed in different ways. A worker can have either type of account or both types.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >A 401(k) is what's known as a defined-contribution plan. The employee and employer can make contributions to the account, up to the dollar limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. By contrast, traditional pensions (not to be confused with traditional 401(k)s) are referred to as defined-benefit plans; the employer is responsible for providing a specific amount of money to the employee upon retirement.2 In recent decades, 401(k) plans have become more plentiful and traditional pensions increasingly rare, as employers have shifted the responsibility and risk of saving for retirement to their employees.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >Employees are also responsible for choosing the specific investments within their 401(k) accounts, from the selection their employer offers. Those offerings typically include an assortment of stock and bond mutual funds as well as target-date funds that hold a mixture of stocks and bonds appropriate in terms of risk for when that person expects to retire. They may also include guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) issued by insurance companies and sometimes the employer's own stock.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >The earnings in a 401(k) account are tax-deferred in the case of traditional 401(k)s and tax-free in the case of Roths. When the owner of a traditional 401(k) makes withdrawals, that money (which has never been taxed) will be taxed as ordinary income. Roth account owners (who have already paid income tax on the money they contributed to the plan) will owe no tax on their withdrawals, as long as they satisfy certain requirements.</p>

        <p
          class="title"
        >Both traditional and Roth 401(k) owners must be at least age 59½—or meet other criteria spelled out by the IRS, such as being totally and permanently disabled—when they start to make withdrawals. Otherwise, they will face an additional 10% early-distribution penalty tax on top of any other tax they owe.</p>

        <p class="title">
          Both types of accounts are also subject to required minimum distributions, or RMDs. (Withdrawals are often referred to as "distributions" in IRS parlance.) After age 70½, account owners must withdraw at least a specified percentage from their 401(k) plans, using IRS tables based on their life expectancy at the time.6 If they are still working and the account is with their current employer, however, they may not have to take RMDs from that plan. (Roth IRAs, unlike Roth 401(k)s, are not subject to RMDs during the owner's lifetime.)
          As a general rule, employees who expect to be in a lower marginal tax bracket after they retire might want to opt for a traditional 401(k) and take advantage of the immediate tax break. On the other hand, employees who expect to be in a higher bracket might opt for the Roth so that they can avoid taxes later. For example, a Roth might be the right choice for a younger worker whose salary is relatively low now but likely to rise substantially over time. Also important, especially if the Roth has years to grow: No tax on withdrawals means that all the money the contributions earn over decades of being in the account is also not taxed.

        >Since no one can predict what tax rates will be decades from now, neither type of 401(k) is a sure thing. For that reason many financial advisors suggest that people hedge their bets, putting some of their money into each.</p>
