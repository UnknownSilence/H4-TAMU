        >Money you tuck away for retirement in your 20s has decades to compound. Make savings automatic, beginning with your first paycheck, and try to ramp up your contributions whenever you get a raise. "Our goal for new employees just getting into the workforce is we want to get them to save 10 percent of their gross wages as soon as possible," says Mark Berg, a certified financial planner and founding principal of Timothy Financial Counsel in Wheaton, Illinois. Those who can't afford 10 percent right away can start smaller. "We try to target 4 to 5 percent initially and then as they get raises we'll add a percent or two to the amount they are putting in," Berg says. If your company has a waiting period before new employees are allowed to join the 401(k) plan, make note of that date and begin participating as soon as you are eligible.</p>

        >An employer match is a powerful incentive to participate in a 401(k) plan. A company match of 50 percent of contributions up to 6 percent of pay for an employee earning $50,000 annually can boost retirement savings by $1,500 each year. If your employer doesn't offer a 401(k) match, it's still worthwhile to invest in a 401(k) for the tax break. Young employees can contribute up to $19,000 to a 401(k) in 2019 and defer income taxes on the amount contributed until retirement.</p>

          Many large companies now automatically enroll new employees in retirement accounts unless they opt out. The most common default investment is a target-date fund. But the default investment strategy may not be right for everyone. Pay attention to how much is being deducted from your paycheck, how that money is being allocated and what fees you are being charged.
          Each 401(k) plan has a small selection of investment options. Choose the mix of stock funds, bonds and cash that fits your personal risk tolerance. If your portfolio loses money in your 20s, you have plenty of time to recover before retirement. Many people gradually shift their holdings to less risky investments as they get closer to retirement. Also, make sure you don't overinvest in your own company by holding too much company stock. "We recommend not to have more than 5 percent invested in any one company stock," says Donald Nicholson Jr., a certified financial planner for Donald W. Nicholson & Associates in Wilmington, Delaware.

        >Pay attention to the fees and expenses associated with the investments offered by your company, which can cut into your returns dramatically over time. Investment fees are deducted from your returns, regardless of how the investment performs. "If the provider offers low-cost index funds, indexes are a nice, low-cost way to build a diversified portfolio," Berg says. Your 401(k) plan is required to send you an annual fee disclosure statement that lists the costs associated with each fund in the 401(k) plan. Check this statement each year to see if there is a lower cost way to invest for retirement.</p>

        >It can be difficult to save for retirement when you also have student loan payments. While it's a good idea to pay off credit cards or other high interest debt as soon as possible, student loans with low fixed interest rates don't necessarily need to be prioritized above retirement savings. "If you borrow money at 3 percent and can invest it at 4 percent, then you want to do that all day long," Kendall says. "If you borrow at 3 percent and invest at 2 percent, you are eventually going to go bankrupt." Also aim to accumulate an emergency fund of at least three to six months' worth of living expenses outside of your retirement account in case you lose your job or incur an unexpected expense.</p>
